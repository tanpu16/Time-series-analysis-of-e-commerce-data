Programming Language used : python
Programming environment used : jupyter (Windows)

Prerequisite for running the code
Instructions to run the code on windows jupyter:
1. Install below packages 
	-pandas   (pip install pandas)
	-matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
	-statsmodels (pip install statsmodel)
		a. statsmodels.tsa.seasonal
		b. statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots
		c. statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax
	-pmdarima  (pip install pmdarima)
	-mean_squared_error (pip install -U scikit-learn)

2. Open the code file ptanpur1_project.ipynb in Jupyter and run the code blocks one by one to see the output on each stage.

3. At the end there is code which will export the final output into the output.txt file. Provide the required path where you want to generate the output file.
Else if path is not provided then the output file will get exported to the path from where you are running the code.
